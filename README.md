# C Programming for Beginners - Master the C Language

This repository contains the Examples, Exercises, and Solutions

Language by Jason Fedin, which covers functions, i.e., sub-
routines or procedures, arguments and parameters, returning data 
from functions, and local and global variables.

<i>Please note, this repository is currently a work in progress 
and will be updated over time.</i>

In this repository, I incorporated Code::Blocks Integrated 
Development Environment (IDE) and the Vim text editor along
with Git and GitHub into my workflow. I also used the Fedora
37 system in a VirtualBox environment to create, use, and
manage directories and files as I worked through the section.

Please feel free to reach out to me at devildoc300@gmail.com
if your have any questions or comments. In addition, feel
free to utilize the source code for your consumption and
edification.

Technical Notes and Considerations
------------------------------------------------------------------------

To compile, build, and execute the Section 9 files and directories,

    (1) click on the blue "Code" button above and click the
        "Download Zip" link, or
    (2) copy the code and paste it directly into your preferred
        Integrated Development Environment (IDE), CLion, CodeLite,
        or Code::Blocks, for example, or your preferred text editor,
        Vim, Nano, or Emacs, for example
    (3) and either compile, build, and execute the files in your 
        IDE, or
    (4) use the following command-line script:
    
            $ gcc name_of_file.c -o main
            $ ./main
